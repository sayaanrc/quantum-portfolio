# Quantum Computing Portfolio

This repository organizes my work in quantum computing, focusing on core algorithms, applied optimization and physics-driven modelling. The listed projects highlight both theoretical understanding and practical implementation experience using Qiskit and Python.

## Applied Quantum Optimization

- **Quantum Optimization of Battery Electrode Configurations**  
  Repository: https://github.com/sayaanrc/quantum-battery-optimization  
  Demonstrates classical benchmarking, Grover-based constrained search and a QAOA-style variational approach applied to a simplified materials-inspired model.

## Core Quantum Algorithms

- **Quantum Algorithms in Qiskit**  
  Repository: https://github.com/sayaanrc/quantum-algorithms-qiskit  
  Implementations include:  
  - Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)  
  - Grover’s Search with a logical oracle (constraint-based marking)  
  - Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)

## Research-Oriented Work

- **Electro-Optic Polarisation Control Using Nematic Liquid Crystals (RRI Project)**  
  Repository: https://github.com/sayaanrc/nematic-lc-polarisation-control  
  Python-based modelling of tunable waveplate behaviour under applied electric fields, developed as part of research training work at the Raman Research Institute (RRI).
