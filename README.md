# Quantum Portfolio

This repository is a curated overview of my projects related to:

- 🧮 Quantum Computing & Qiskit
- 🧱 Quantum Materials & Computational Material Science
- 🤖 Quantum Machine Learning
- 📊 Numerical Physics & Simulations

It is intended as a single place for PIs, mentors, research groups, and R&D teams to explore my work.

## 🔹 1. Battery Electrodes using Quantum Algorithms (Qiskit)

**Repo:** *(to be added)*  

A project exploring how quantum algorithms can help in **optimising battery electrode materials** for improved energy efficiency and performance.  
Based on my project work, implemented and extended using **Qiskit**.

---

## 🔹 2. Core Quantum Algorithms (Qiskit)

**Repo:** *(will be:* `quantum-algorithms-qiskit`*)*  

Implements foundational algorithms:

- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)  
- Grover’s Search  
- Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) on simple Hamiltonians  

Each in a clean Jupyter notebook with explanation and visualization.

👉 *(Will link after repo exists.)*

## 🔹 3. Quantum Machine Learning

**Repo:** *(will be:* `qiskit-quantum-ml-classifier`*)*  

Demonstrates simple quantum ML workflows such as:

- Parameterized quantum circuit classifier  
- Classical baseline (logistic regression / SVM)
- Comparative performance and training curves

---

## 🔹 4. Additional Work & Engineering Projects

Other relevant academic and technical projects, including:

- AI-Based Reforestation Drones  
- Automated Water Cleaning Bot  
- Numerical physics simulations and modeling notebooks  

These will be organised and linked here as separate repositories.

## 🧪 Structure & How to Run

Each linked repository includes:

- A `README.md` explaining the idea and physics  
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)  
- A `requirements.txt` file  

All projects use:
