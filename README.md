# Quantum Portfolio

This repository will serve as a structured index of my work in quantum computing, quantum algorithms, quantum machine learning, and related research.

Currently included:

- **Electro-Optic Polarisation Control Using Nematic Liquid Crystals (RRI Project)**  
  Repository: https://github.com/sayaanrc/nematic-lc-polarisation-control

Additional quantum computing projects will be added incrementally.
